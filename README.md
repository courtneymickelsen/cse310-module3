# Overview

I am just beginning to learn Swift, so I created this simple "Guess the Number" game to help me learn and practice the Swift language syntax.

The game selects a random number, then prompts the user for a guess, directing them to guess higher or lower until they get the correct number. This game will only work in an Xcode Command Line Project, not a Playground because you cannot take user input in a playground.

# Development Environment

I used Apple's Xcode to develop this program. 
The program is written in Swift

# Future Work

* Not program specific, but I want to learn more about Projects and Playgrounds in Xcode/Swift, their limitations, differences, uses, etc.
* I'd like to turn this into a real app where the user plays in an on-screen interface rather than the command line
